# Configuration Files

This directory contains configuration files that cannot be placed in their respective directories.

For example, in the case of [secretstore.yaml](https://github.com/honahuku/manifest/blob/main/config/secretstore.yaml), it could not be declared with the external-secrets application and its directory, so it is placed here.
